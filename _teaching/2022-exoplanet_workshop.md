The course will be given by Prof. Anand Narayan from Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology, with daily interaction of 1-2 hours and hand on sessions.   The main motivation for this short course is that the study of exoplanets is a fast developing field, with potential for many interesting future discoveries. The course will cover, in a quantitative way, the techniques that have been most successful in finding planets around other stars, the search for biomarkers in exoplanet atmospheres, and the speculations on the potential habitability of exoworlds. The course would also involve two programming based mini-projects with hand on activities, where the students will learn the technique used in this field, as well as get a  feel for possibilities of any other civilizations  in this vast Universe. The registered participants will also get the certification of participation.Please fill the form below for the registration before 12:00hr on 16th May 2022.
