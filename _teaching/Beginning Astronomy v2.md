**Theme of workshop :** Modern day telescopes produce petabytes of observational data while cosmological simulations push supercomputers to the limits. The publicly accessible nature of a plethora of astronomical datasets thus allows for a hands-on introduction to astronomy for students with basic training in physics, mathematics and computation (late Bachelors/ early Masters level). In this 3-day workshop, we will
introduce students to some core concepts in stellar and galaxy astrophysics through a mix of short lectures and hands-on computational sessions with publicly available astronomical databases.
