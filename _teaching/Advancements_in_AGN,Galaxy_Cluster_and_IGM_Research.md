**About the Workshop :** Modern day telescopes produce petabytes of observational data while cosmological simulations push supercomputers to the limits. The publicly accessible nature of a plethora of astronomical datasets thus allows for a hands-on introduction to astronomy for students with basic training in physics, mathematics and computation (late Bachelors/ early Masters level). In this 3-day workshop, we will introduce students to some core concepts in stellar and galaxy astrophysics through a mix of short lectures and hands-on computational sessions with publicly available astronomical databases.

**Venue and Time :**  The venue of the '**Beginning Astronomy v2: Start a data-driven journey**' workshop is Shahpur Campus of the CUHP, and is about 30 Km from our Main Campus at Dharamshala. The address is: \\
                    **Central University of Himachal Pradesh, Shahpur Parisar** \\
                    **District Kangra, Himachal Pradesh** \\
                    **India 176206**
