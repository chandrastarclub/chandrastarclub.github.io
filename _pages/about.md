**MOTIVATION** :   In the 21st century, as the global scientific pursuits provide an enormous amount of new revelations about the natural world, the gap between the general  public and the scientific community widens more than ever. The goal of public outreach efforts, in general, is to spread awareness about established scientific knowledge among the public, with an underlying hope to inculcate a spirit of rationalism in the populace.


**EXISTING PERSPECTIVE:**   The citizen programs in the field of Science are notable especially in Astronomy as  amateur Astronomers, although the geographic footprints of these programs are much limited. Notable long-standing citizen driven organizations like Jyotirvidya Parisanstha in Pune and Skywatchers’ Association in Kolkata have been gathering, training and guiding amateur astronomers to make a serious contribution to the field. But most of the data collection ventures that the Indian  amateur astronomers are involved in international programs. But it is time for Indian practising scientists and faculties in Higher Education Institute to come up with more indigenous programs in different fields of science that have the ability to engage the public in large numbers.

Even in the conventional public outreach dissemination programs, the scientific content is limited to well-established scientific notions, largely representing the international scientific community, while the practising Indian scientific communities are largely underrepresented in such deliberations. Now efforts are being made to organize public symposia where practicing Indian scientists present their own research in an accessible way to the citizens, for example, the ‘Science at the Sabha’ program organized by the Institute of Mathematical Sciences in Chennai. Some individual efforts are being taken toward more concerted programs undertaken by practising scientists/educator from all domains of natural sciences. More such efforts will lead to a better connection between the practising Indian scientists/researcher and the general public, leading to the development of trust and support for Indian science in general, apart from the positive impact on the ‘awareness’ aspects.

` `Another recent development is the *Atal Tinkering Laboratory program* where laboratory

equipment is provided to schools under a Government-funded national program, to encourage students in technological innovations. But while designing and running such a lab under this program, one must also lay emphasis on introducing the students to rational thinking and scientific methodologies that can derive the established scientific principles, apart from the mandated intention of enthusing them into more utilitarian technological innovations, where creating a setup like science club/outreach center as a nodal point by higher education research institute, like central University of Himachal Pradesh,  will play a crucial role.


**CUHP KEY ROLE:**

Taking science centers to the remotest places of the nation is rare, but a large number of district-level science centers have been established all around the country. But we have witnessed great personal efforts towards that end. Most notable among them are the phenomenal efforts put into the ‘Toys from Trash’ project led by Arvind Gupta and his team at IUCAA science centre, who introduce children to a world of toys made from trivial trash based on some simple scientific principles, something that needs to be widely propagated and replicated all around the country. Rural centers in the underprivileged remote areas of the country, incorporating location-specific environmental and architectural elements, equipped with the simplest of tools to allow local school-going children to run experiments based on their textbook knowledge, will be a great way to induce scientific temper among the future citizens and engage more people with the process of scientific progress in general.

CUHP  believes that the benefits of high-quality science education and infrastructure should not remain restricted to members of the CUHP only. As an attempt to spread the excitement of science and to make the expertise and facilities at CUHP available to the science and education community of the Himachal Pradesh, we would like to engage in several "Science, Technology, and Astronomy  Realisation (STAR)" outreach activities. These encompass skywatching programs, social outreach in the local community, capacity building of teachers, making and popularizing simple science toys, and effectively communicating scientific research through various media.

In this context the Department of Physics and Astronomical Science of CIHP  proposed to set up a   Chandra “Science, Technology and Astronomy  Realisation (STAR)” Club **[Chandra- STAR-Club]** at  CUHP, named after renowned nobel laureate and the father of astrophysics, Prof. S. Chandrasekhar.

The *Chandra-STAR-Club*   will be a nodal center to communicate and facilitate by optimizing the  scientific human-manpower and resources in Himachal Pradesh, with  main focus on the following aspects:

1. SkyWatching program for school students and general public
1. Public lecture about various astronomical and other scientific events
1. General public outreach lectures series.
   - Schools can request for expert talk and Chandra-STAR-Club can coordinate to put in touch the field expert beside assisting in logistics if possible.
   - Chandra START Club also organizes pedagogical lecture series by targeting the specific students' level and regions to enhance Science Technology Engineering and Mathematical (STEM) Education in the region.
1. Workshops/schools for teachers and/or students.
1. Online aggregation of science activities, audio/video resources, and various science awareness programs.

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right.
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
