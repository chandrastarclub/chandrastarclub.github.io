**ABSTRACT** The temporal changes in the sun are observed with different time scales. Short time scale variabilities impact our day to day life, particularly our space environment, whereas long term variability can impact our climate. In this talk I will show results from observations of the variation of solar activity and will try to theorise possible sources of this variability. After the solar research context I will provide an overview on research activities at ARIES  and discuss possible collaborative avenues which can be explored between ARIES and CUHP.
