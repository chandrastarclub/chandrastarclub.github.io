**ABSTRACT** In the framework of "Big-Bang" cosmology, by observing the properties of very distant object we will be able to reconstruct the time evolution of our universe, how various structure like Galaxies formed and evolved over cosmic time. Telescopes are the main tools for this exploration. Several extremely large telescopes will be operational, covering a wide range of wavelengths, in the next decade. Indian astronomers will be part of most of these large projects. Enhanced sensitivity of these telescopes and associated instruments will allow us to detect and study very faint and most distant objects in the universe.
In this presentation, the author will provide an overview of various science questions that will be addressed using these facilities.
